In Objective-C, a tricky bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management.  If an observer is not properly removed when it's no longer needed, it can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  This is especially true if the observed object is deallocated while the observer is still registered.  The observer might try to access the deallocated object, leading to a EXC_BAD_ACCESS error.  Another issue stems from using weak references to the observer. If the observer is deallocated before the observed object, the weak reference will become nil, preventing the observer from being properly removed. This can result in the observer's deallocation still being problematic, either due to deallocation callbacks or other related methods.
