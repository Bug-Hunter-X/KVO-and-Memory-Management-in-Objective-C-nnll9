# Objective-C KVO Memory Management Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Objective-C related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and memory management.  The bug arises from failing to properly remove KVO observers, particularly when dealing with weak references.

## The Bug

The `KVO_Memory_Bug.m` file contains code that illustrates the problem.  An observer is added to an object, but it isn't always removed correctly, leading to potential crashes or undefined behavior when the observed object is deallocated.

## The Solution

The `KVO_Memory_Solution.m` file provides a corrected version of the code.  It addresses the memory management issues by ensuring that KVO observers are always removed when they are no longer needed, regardless of whether weak references are used.
